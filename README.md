# Data-Quality-Analysis-Using-BERT
# This project helps in understanding the Data Quality Analysis using BERT
# BERT(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a natural language processing (NLP) model developed by Google. It's a neural network that analyzes text by considering the context of words in a sentence, rather than just looking at them one by one. BERT is used to improve the accuracy of search engines, language translation, and conversational AI.
# This project uses BERT token to detect the Anamolies present in the data.
# NOTE:IN THIS PROJECT WE HAVE TAKEN A SIMPLE DATASET.
# THIS Project Also has multiple Visualizations that helps in understanding the Data Quality Analysis using BERT.
# The visualizations are :-
